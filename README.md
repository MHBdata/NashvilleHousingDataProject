# NashvilleHousingProject

For this project, I focused on the cleaning and transformation of a dataset containing information about Nashville Houses, their owners, adress, parcel ID, sale date and more.

You can find all the SQL code I wrote in the sql file.

The dataset was taken from Alex The Analyst Github repository.
